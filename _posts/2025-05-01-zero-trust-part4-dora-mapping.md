## What This Article Will Cover

Part 4 is designed as a standalone audit reference. It consolidates the control mappings from Parts 1–3 into a single, comprehensive table that can be used directly in audit preparation, evidence collection, and regulatory dialogue.

Planned content includes:

- Complete mapping table: Entra ID control → DORA Article → BaFin BAIT section
- Evidence collection guidance for each control — what logs and reports to export
- Gap analysis template — how to assess your current posture against the full control set
- Auditor FAQ — common questions and how to answer them with technical evidence
- Controls that satisfy multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously (DORA + NIS2 + ISO 27001)
