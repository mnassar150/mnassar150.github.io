## What This Article Will Cover

The third Zero Trust principle — **Assume Breach** — shifts the mindset from prevention to containment. It assumes that a breach has already occurred or will occur, and designs security controls accordingly to minimise blast radius and accelerate detection and response.

Planned topics include:

- Network segmentation and microsegmentation strategy
- Microsoft Sentinel integration with Entra ID risk signals
- Defender for Identity — detecting lateral movement and credential attacks
- Incident response playbooks triggered by Entra ID Protection
- Privileged Access Workstations (PAW) design
- Blast radius reduction through group and application scoping
- DORA Article 10 and 11 mapping — detection and containment obligations
