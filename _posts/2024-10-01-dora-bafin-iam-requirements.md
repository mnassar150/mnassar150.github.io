## What This Article Will Cover

DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) became applicable in January 2025 for all EU financial entities. BaFin BAIT has governed German financial institutions' IT security requirements for years. Both frameworks have direct, specific implications for how identity and access management must be designed, operated, and evidenced. This article cuts through the regulatory language.

Planned topics include:

- **DORA Article 9** explained: what "ICT security policies" actually means for IAM
- **DORA Article 10** explained: detection obligations and what counts as "anomalous activity"
- **DORA Article 11** explained: containment requirements and how IAM controls satisfy them
- **BaFin BAIT Chapter 5** — identity and access management specific requirements
- The overlap between DORA and BAIT — where one control satisfies both
- What auditors actually ask for — evidence types and how to collect them from Entra ID
- Common gaps found in IAM audits at financial institutions
- Building a control mapping register for ongoing compliance management
