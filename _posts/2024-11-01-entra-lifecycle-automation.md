## What This Article Will Cover

Manual joiner-mover-leaver processes are a consistent audit finding in regulated environments. They are slow, error-prone, and create orphaned accounts and excessive access. This article covers building a reliable, auditable automation layer using PowerShell and the Microsoft Graph API.

Planned topics include:

- Authentication to Microsoft Graph API using certificates and managed identities (not client secrets)
- Joiner automation — provisioning accounts, assigning licenses, adding to groups, triggering TAP for MFA registration
- Mover automation — updating attributes, adjusting group memberships, triggering access reviews on role change
- Leaver automation — disabling accounts, revoking sessions, removing licenses, archiving mailboxes
- Error handling and retry logic for production reliability
- Audit logging — writing automation actions to a Log Analytics workspace for compliance evidence
- Scheduling with Azure Automation or Logic Apps
- DORA mapping: how automation supports ICT asset management obligations

```powershell
# Example: Revoke all active sessions for a leaver
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.ReadWrite.All"
Revoke-MgUserSignInSession -UserId "user@contoso.com"
```
