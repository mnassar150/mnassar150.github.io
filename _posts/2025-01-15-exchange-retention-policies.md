## What This Article Will Cover

Retention policies in Exchange Online are frequently misconfigured, misunderstood, or underestimated in regulated environments. Getting them wrong can mean either data loss (deleting what you should have kept) or compliance exposure (keeping what you should have deleted). This article bridges the gap between regulatory requirement and technical configuration.

Planned topics include:

- How retention policies and retention labels work in Microsoft Purview — and when to use which
- Designing retention timelines aligned to BaFin and DORA obligations
- Litigation Hold vs. retention policy — when each applies and how they interact
- Scoping policies to mailboxes, groups, and public folders correctly
- Common mistakes: why "delete after X days" policies silently fail without testing
- Monitoring retention using Content Search and eDiscovery
- Audit log evidence collection for regulatory review
