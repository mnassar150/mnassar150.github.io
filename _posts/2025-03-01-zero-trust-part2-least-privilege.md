## What This Article Will Cover

The second Zero Trust principle — **Use Least Privilege Access** — is about ensuring every identity, human or workload, has access to only what it needs, exactly when it needs it, for as long as it needs it.

Planned topics include:

- Privileged Identity Management (PIM) — just-in-time privileged access
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) design principles in Entra ID
- Access Reviews — automated periodic review of group and role memberships
- Entitlement Management — access packages and approval workflows
- Workload identity least privilege — service principals and managed identities
- DORA and BaFin BAIT regulatory mapping for each control
